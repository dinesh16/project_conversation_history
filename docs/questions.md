## Questions

- Are there any preferred database options?  
  At present, the default is SQLite.

- Could you clarify the possible project statuses?  

- Currently, projects cannot be created directly through the app, but I have loaded two test projects.  

- As this is a test project, I assumed authentication isn't required.  

- I focused primarily on delivering the requested feature within the timeframe, without placing much emphasis on styling—hope that’s acceptable.  

- Is pagination required for the comments section?  

- Should we include an option to edit/delete comments?
